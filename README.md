It is the Saudi Football Platform Application consisting of 4 types of users: Admin, Team, Player, and Visitor, where the supervisor adds the teams and each team adds its players and their contracts

The team creates the match and determines its date and time, the two participating teams, the stadium, the sponsor, and the prize

The visitor can view all teams and their news without logging in

The application was programmed using the Flutter framework with linking to APIs to make the application available for Android and iOS
